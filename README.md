A cross-platform, extensible, and fast library for displaying data at runtime.

## Nomenclature
> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",<br>

I use [Backus-Naur Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)
throughout this document. The terminal symbol<br>
*e* without quotes means "nothing", or the absence of something.

If the form I use in this document is confusing, I encourage you to submit<br>
an issue, and we can discuss how to make it more clear for everyone :-)

<br>

## Purpose
There are plenty of tools available for displaying data in C++. A short list:<br>

<li> <a href=https://github.com/alandefreitas/matplotplusplus>matplotplusplus</a>
<li> <a href=https://github.com/graphia-app/graphia>graphia</a>
<li> <a href=https://github.com/tbattz/openGLPlotLive>openGLPlotLive</a>

<br>

These tools are impressive and extensive, but they're also complex and require<br>
time to learn and use properly. This library trades extensibility and<br>
customizability for simplicity and ease of use. It might even serve as a<br>
prototyping library, until the user is ready to learn a more complex data<br>
visualization tool.

<br>

## Goals
<li> MUST provide an API for software engineers and programmers to display<br>
     arbitrary data in a uniform and consistent manner
<li> MUST NOT add a significant burden to the maintenance or development of<br>
the program in which it is used
<li> MUST provide packages for installation (todo)
<li> MUST support C++17 and later
<li> SHOULD support C++11 and later

<br>

In addition, the
[Boost library requirements](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_34_0/more/lib_guide.htm)
and guidelines SHOULD be used to<br>
guide the creation of the library.

<br>

## Configure and Build

```sh
cmake -B _build -S . <options>
cmake --build _build --target <target>
```
where
```sh
<options> ::= <option>
            | <option> <options>
            | e

<option> ::= '-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE='<build-type>
            | '-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS='<shared-libs>

<build-type> ::= 'Release' | 'Debug' | 'MinSizeRel' | 'RelWithDebInfo'

<shared-libs> ::= 'On' | 'Off'

<target> ::= 'displayit'
```

## Usage

```sh
todo
```

## Run tests

```sh
todo
```
